# Galaxy-Spoofer-Reversed

This kid named Galaxy thought that he could scam people without getting his program cracked by me. Anyways, as you can see in the Dumped Files folder, he use to inject a leaked dll in order to get the client unbanned. Btw he doesnt even used any at least FREE encryption for his C++ Pasted Source Code. Imagine Using VMProtect without a custom Tamper or any other custom protection Script!!
